## Technical Specifications
The concept of this project is quite simple I took inspiration from Street Fighter, tried to create something like a forum.

This application has:

1. Three models â€“ one representing someone using the application (a user), one representing a collection of projects (a portfolio) and a third model for the individual projects (a project).
2. Complete RESTful routes for at least one resource (a project) with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
3. Uses Mongo queries and the Mongoose module to interact with a document database.
4. Promises to help build more complex queries!
5. Wireframes that were designed during the planning process.
6. Deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
